###The Legend of Nelda Search For The Anti-Triforce###

####This is a game created by Chahine Koleejan, Christain Evaroa, Chris Gibbs, Peter Alexander and myself, for SWEN222 2013 at Victoria University of Wellington####

#####Overview#####
The game is an adventure game where the goal is to solve puzzles to collect piece of the anti-trifore, to unlock the final puzzles
while also collecting coins, to buy weapons and items to aid you on your journey through the world. The game is rendered in a 
sort of 2D, 3D mix, similar to pokemon in that although all elements are rendered on the screen in a 2D way such that they are always the same size
, you are able to walk behind items that are obscuring the tile behind then, giving the effect of a psuedo 3D world (sometimes refered to as 2.5D)
Although the game is playable, there is very little to do at this stage, until I can implement more puzzles and create a larger map to make it feel more like a game.

#####Completed so far#####
* The basic renederer
* The basis of the game mechanics, i.e all the basic classes of the objects are created.
* Some Objects i.e. Keys, Swords, Coins, Map objects, Puzzle elements.
* Basic Networking allowing multiple players to move around the creen and interact with each other.
* A basic Gui to allow for the starting of a server and client, interacting of objects in the bag and purchasing of items in the store

#####Still TODO (in order of importance)#####
* Implement more stable and reliable networking to replace the existing duct taped together one currrently implemented.
* Implement a better designed more stable GUI to replace the existing one.
* fix the archer to allow it to be played correctly.
* Implement more objects and puzzles to make the game feel more full.
* Add to the map to make it more like a game as apposed to a demo.

#####Current state of the project#####
With univesity on at the moment there is very little time for me to make any progress at this time
